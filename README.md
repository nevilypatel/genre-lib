# genre-lib
Library management project for SGP
# Abstract and Introduction to project


In todayâ€™s modern world where technology plays a very vital part into our day to day life, there are still the libraries that use the classic system. This system is designed to locate materials in libraries. The system works to show the location of material and some description of the same. The system provides information for any of the material in library. 

Basically this project is created to simplify the rush and to save time. In this if you enter author name than you will be provided with the books that is written by that author and also some description of it such as book name, author name, Category of the book and addressof the material which is stored in library. This project saves your time because it will tell you if the material that you want is available or not and if it is than the address of that material so you can goo to that address and directly take your material.

This project use java as the programming language as it is an object oriented programming language

For this project I got reference from open source on Youtube and documentation.
